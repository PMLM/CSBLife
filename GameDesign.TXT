GAME DESIGN DISCUSSION
"In-Game Tutorial Decisions"

This is interesting because an often overlooked
aspect in video game making is tutorials. Or 
specifically, how the player learns how to play
the game and; thus, immerse himself/herself
in the game's world.

In the forum, most of the focus was on making
the game 'simple' (but not overly so that a player
could breeze through the entire game without so
much as batting an eyelash) to learn. 

There was an answer that opposed the idea that a
game should give a hint after a player dies. It is
a valid point because oft times I felt a little stupid
after losing a game that tells me I should have done
this to avoid such a mistake.

Another point that was raised was teaching the game
through little quests that enabled the player to explore
the game controls and mechanics without having to 
read through lengthy tutorials or sit through voice-overs
of some sort. Both of which are boring and would
often times prompt a player to rapidly press the 'next
button' or select the 'skip dialogue' option.

Considering players with a fairly short patience, I 
think it is wise to keep tutorials interactive so that
the player learns while actively participating in the 
learning process.

Another interesting point was to allow game
testers to play the game and see in which areas they
got confused or lost in and patterning a tutorial to
remedy the learning curve present in the game.

I think this is a very interesting discussion 
because one day I hope to make a game that
will be interestingly complicated but not too 
complicated that players would be too frustrated
learning which way is up and which way is down to
play.

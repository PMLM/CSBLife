New Things about Saint John Baptiste De La Salle

“Remembering that God is with you will help and inspire you in all that you do.” 
---Letter 2—to a Brother, 15 May 1701.

Saint John Baptiste De La Salle never intended to become the founder of what is
now known as the De La Salle Brothers; nor, did he dream that one day he would
be the firestarter of all these schools established all over the world.

He said it himself, if he was to have known all his work would have led up to
that point he would have quit. Nobody can blame him. What he did was no joke,
it was no mole's hill.

Saint John Baptise had a difficult time with his mission because of the opposition
presented to him. And his quote, the one mentioned above, is a reminder that God
will always be behind everything that one does. He drew his inspiration from God, 
that is why, despite all the opposition, he was able to go on through with his mission.

Who would even dream of continuing a mission such as his when the church opposed?
Surely, it was God urging Saint John Baptiste to continue with his mission until
finally the church gave way and finally accepted and recognized him for his efforts.

In his letter to a brother, he seemed to say not to give up and push forward because
God was always there watching. God will not leave and will always be there to help
and inspire because as long as one continues to will it, it shall be done.

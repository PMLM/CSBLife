1. Have you ever failed an exam? What were the reasons for failing?
--I have failed an exam before because I neglected my duties to study.
     I knew very well that I did not fully grasp the lesson yet I cont-
     inued to waste time. That is something I wish not do do ever ag-
     ain.


2. For those who haven't failed an exam, what was your highest 
	score? What made you reach the top?
--I cannot answer this question because I've already failed an exam.
     That is probably something that only a very select few can truly
     brag about, that is, never failing an examination.

3. How was your first experience of CSB midterm examinations? 
	Knowing what you know now, what would you have 
	done differently? What are you going to do again for
	the CSB finals?
--It was in a way 'easier' than I thought it would be because I kept
     telling myself that the exams would be difficult because I was
     already in college. It was really a big surprise to find out that
     the exam was 'sane' and pretty much was just like the exams I
     took in Highschool. Or that could be because I studied in a De
     La Salle school; hence, the similarity. I would probably have 
     pushed myself harder knowing that things were actually not
     as difficult as I had imagined them to be. I would probably 
     still continue to study for the upcoming exams, what else 
     would I do?

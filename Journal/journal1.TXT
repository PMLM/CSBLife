[[ Get. Out. Of. My. Class. ]]
August 26, 2011, Friday

If there was anything I was to regret of this
day it would be this: cellphone.

I have never been much of a cellphone person.
Calling and texting were always such boring
social endeavors that I always frowned at
the mere thought of having to text someone.

The useless group messages I often received
did nothing to make me enjoy the digital world
of telecommunication.

I guess today was a sort of wake-up slap that
I had to learn to ride with the flow and just
have the little device handy.

Today was one very unproductive day and that's
not because I was off day-dreaming. So it surprised
me that classes were light and barely 'academic.'

I shouldn't have been too surprised when our
Aesthethics teacher had gotten annoyed at my
block's general boisterousness and told us to
just leave.

But what really kicked my day into the mud
pile was when I learned that my 'early dismissal'
coincided with my friend's meet-up place just
outside CSB. And these are my high school
friends- close buddies that are like chocolate
and vanilla on ice cream. So sweet there would
be so much diabetes.

But I had no phone!

No way to even know what was going on.

And boy, did they try to contact me.

Lesson learned: Phones are important if one
wants to keep a social life.

Star Recital 2011; June 1, 2011

I've learned that there must be faith, no matter what happens, 
no matter what will happen. Like in the shadow play where 
the mother would tell stories to the little girl about how she
lost her wings and how she came to be with them.

It was a sad story, how the mother had to be taken away as
the payment for being granted one of God's favorite angels.

My favorite story would be the story about the little girl
who was hinted at to be an actual angel. It was a nice
story that I remember the most.

It made me think of my mother and how she is working
just to keep me in college. I must be more appreciative
and strive to make the most of the opportunities she is 
giving me.

The production was midly interesting. The shadow play was
interesting; so much more than I expected. The people
who worked back stage to deliver the shadow play were really
talented so I'm sort of happy I watched it. I don't quite
remember much of the play since it did not leave a big 
impression on me, all I can say is that the shadow play was
interesting to watch because of how well it was made.

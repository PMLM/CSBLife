Frosh Solidarity Night; May 20, 2011

The event, while enclosed within a hot building
with lots of FROSH students was a learning 
experience.

Not entirely coated with new knowledge but it 
does provide as some sort of reminder and 
entertainment. New college experiences were 
represented in a comedic skit and cheers, of which
I've heard and learned back in my high school days,
rang through out the building which brought 

Frosh solidarity night served as a wake-up slap
to me. Hey, you're in college this is where your
high school friends and yourself part ways for real, 
that's what it seemed to tell me.

And true enough everyone of my high school friends
are walking their own paths because, as far as I
know, I'm the only one from DLSZ that is taking 
up BS-IT.

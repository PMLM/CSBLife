Frosh Orientation; May 19, 2011

The orientation was a helpful event for all those
present, that is the FROSH and probably some
transfer students that will also begin a new in
De La Salle College of Saint Benilde.

The orientation gave me a lot of insight about
what college life in CSB will be like. As a SMIT
student, I was surprised to have to follow a set
dress code but at the same time I found this change
to be somewhat pleasant. Pleasant because there was
some sort of training/experience to be found from 
such a dress code.

I took up High School in De La Salle Zobel so most 
of the orientation was reminiscent of what I already 
experienced in Zobel.

In that orientation, I was able to meet some new faces
and among them a few hidden gems that could possibly
become my friends as the year progresses even if we
are not in the same classes after the term ends.

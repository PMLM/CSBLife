To prevent such an event from happening it is important
to care for the environment. Make the first move, as it is
coined today. If we are all waiting for someone to make 
the first move in saving the environment then we will all
be waiting and nothing will be done. And before we even 
realize it it would be too late.

As a La Sallian, it is not just an option- it is etched into
our path. This movement to save the environment should
run thick in our veins- La Sallian or not, though, we must
all care for the environment. Despite such saying sounding
repetetive and dull- it is true and we must not waste anytime
in moving.

As La Sallians we must aim to be examples to the others.
We are not followers- we are the firestarters.

One Benildean core value is social responsibility. We are
tasked with the notion that we must be responsible for
not only our acts but the impact that humankind has on
mother earth. 

Another would be professional competence. In this way we
must do our best in the task we are given. We must be able
to learn in this vastly changing world and be able to adapt 
to it in such a way that we do not get lost in the way.

The play gave emphasis to what we are presently facing.
That is the degredation of our planet. Our planet- the
ONLY planet earth. We only have this once chance and 
once we ruin it it would be all over and we'll be completely 
at a loss of what to do.

Again, we have to act now. Nobody needs to tell us what 
to do. We are La Sallians and we are the fire starters.

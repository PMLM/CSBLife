NSTP Orientation; June 28, 2011

NSTP, or the National Service Training Program, aims
to enhance nationalism, self-awareness, defensive 
preparedness and civic consciousness. The NSTP promotes
team building and heightens the Filipino sense of unity
and compassion.

As a Benildean La Sallian the NSTP will help me aquire
skills and experience that will enable me to act in times of
need and to impart my knowledge to other Filipinos so that
they too can be part of a well-bonded nation.

ROTC:
-- this deals with military training and awareness. Through
this Filipinos will be able to defend the nation and the 
common folk.

CWTS
-- this enables the youth/Filipino to provide help and share
their experiences to enrich other Filipinos.

LTS
-- enables the Filipino to teach the younger generation
academically and pave a way for a brighter future.

I shall enlist myself under CWTS. For my mother will
not approve of me joining the ROTC and learning how to
hold a gun. I am also the worst teacher because I do not
have the patience to teach others. And I am usually unable 
to explain mathematical concepts because I just 'know how
to do them' but am unable to put them into plain words.

Under CWTS I hope to be able to immerse myself into the
Filipino world and help others realize their potential and
path in the world.
